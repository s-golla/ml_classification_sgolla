## 1. Clarity & Organization ✅

The notebook is cleanly structured and easy to follow. Each section is clearly labeled, and the flow from data loading to preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation is logical. The use of Markdown cells to explain each step is helpful for readers unfamiliar with the dataset or methods.

**Suggestions for improvement:**  
Consider adding a brief summary at the beginning outlining the overall goal and approach. This would help orient readers before diving into the code.

---

## 2. Feature Selection & Justification ✅

The selected features appear relevant to the classification task, and the preprocessing steps (e.g., handling missing values, encoding) are well executed. The rationale for feature selection is implied through the workflow, though not explicitly stated.

**Suggestions for improvement:**  
It would strengthen the analysis to include a short explanation of why certain features were chosen or excluded—perhaps supported by correlation analysis or domain reasoning.

---

## 3. Model Performance & Comparisons ✅

Multiple models are tested, and performance metrics are clearly presented. The comparison between models is informative, and the use of accuracy and confusion matrices helps illustrate strengths and weaknesses.

**Suggestions for improvement:**  
Consider adding precision, recall, or F1-score for a more nuanced view, especially if the classes are imbalanced. A brief discussion on why one model outperforms others would also be valuable.

---

## 4. Reflection Quality ✅

The reflection section demonstrates thoughtful engagement with the results. The author acknowledges limitations and suggests future improvements, which shows a good understanding of the modeling process.

**Suggestions for improvement:**  
Expanding the reflection to include what was learned about the dataset or modeling choices would deepen the insight. Also, linking back to the original objectives would help close the loop.

---

**Overall:**  
This is a strong submission with clear organization and solid modeling. With minor additions to feature justification and metric diversity, it would be even more robust and insightful.
